# odin-recipes
My first github repository!
This is the start of the Odin Project.
I'm hoping to launch a new career in frontend development. I've been a chef for over 20 years and although I've had a career, it's time for a change. I've always been interested in computers and used to design websites before I was serious about cooking. Back then you only designed websites in HTML. This was before CSS was widely used! You should see some of those websites. It's amazing what I did back then with only a text editor and an ftp account. It was a lot of back and forth but I believe that it gave me a strong foundation in how computer languages work.
